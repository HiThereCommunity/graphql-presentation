# GraphQL Presentation

Presentation containing the lessons learned from implementing a GraphQL API.

This presentation highlights two lessons:

1. **Separation of Concerns:** How should you structure your code to create a maintainable GraphQL server.
2. **Relay compliant schema:** Create a Relay compliant schema to benefit from all the advantages that it brings.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies by running the command:

```sh
yarn
```

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

## Build & Deployment

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`
